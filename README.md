## Design Patterns
### Singleton Design Pattern
#### GameManager Class
The Singleton Design Pattern is implemented in the `GameManager` class to ensure that only one instance of the class exists during the game's lifecycle. This pattern provides a single point of access to shared data, such as `playerName`, `npcFound`, `buildingsFound`, and `volume`, making it easy to manage and synchronize game state globally.

### Builder Design Pattern
#### SoundManager Class
The **Builder Design Pattern** is used in the `SoundManager` class to simplify the creation of complex sound objects with multiple configurations. The `Builder` class allows incremental and flexible object construction through method chaining.

- The `Builder` class provides methods like `setbgMusic()` and `setAmbience()` to set specific properties of the `SoundManager` instance.
- The `build()` method creates a new `SoundManager` instance, passing the builder itself for initialization.

### State Design Pattern
#### Screen State Class
The **State Design Pattern** is implemented through the `ScreenState` interface and the `WildCatScreen` abstract class. This pattern allows the game's screen to change dynamically, representing different states of the application (e.g., main menu, gameplay, or pause menu).

- **`ScreenState` Interface**: Defines the behavior for transitioning between screens with the `changeScreen(GameScreen screen)` method.
- **`WildCatScreen` Abstract Class**: Serves as a base class for specific screens, like gameplay or menus, and ensures consistent structure and behavior for screen management.

This pattern simplifies state transitions and promotes better organization by encapsulating screen-specific behavior in separate classes.
### Game Loop Design Pattern

The **Game Loop Design Pattern** is inherently utilized in the `Game` class provided by the libGDX framework. This pattern is foundational in game development, managing the continuous update and rendering cycle that drives a game.

- **Core Concept**: The game loop ensures that the game processes input, updates the game state, and renders frames in a consistent and efficient manner, regardless of the platform or hardware.
- **Implementation in libGDX**:
    - The `render()` method in the `Game` class is called repeatedly, typically synchronized with the frame rate. It invokes the `render()` method of the active `Screen`, passing the time delta since the last frame.
    - Methods like `pause()`, `resume()`, and `resize()` handle transitions between different game states or screen dimensions.
    - The `setScreen()` method allows swapping between different game screens while maintaining a consistent loop.

In the `GameLauncher` class, which extends `Game`, the `create()` method initializes resources and sets the initial game screen (e.g., `MainMenu`). The game loop then manages the flow of the application, invoking the screen's `render()` and other lifecycle methods as needed.

This design pattern ensures that the game's state remains synchronized with the rendering process, providing smooth gameplay and responsiveness.

### Factory Design Pattern
#### NPCFactory Class

The **Factory Design Pattern** is implemented in the `NPCFactory` class to simplify the creation of NPCs with predefined attributes and behaviors.

- **Methods**:
    - createNPCs() method: Generates a list of NPCs with specified positions and movement types.
    - setTargets() method: Configures dynamic movement targets for specific NPCs. 

This pattern ensures consistent NPC initialization and supports easy expansion or modification of NPC types.

## Additional References

This is a [libGDX](https://libgdx.com/) project generated with [gdx-liftoff](https://github.com/libgdx/gdx-liftoff).

This project was generated with a template including simple application launchers and a main class extending `Game` that sets the first screen.

## About LibGDX
### Platforms
- `core`: Main module with the application logic shared by all platforms.
- `lwjgl3`: Primary desktop platform using LWJGL3; was called 'desktop' in older docs.

### Gradle

This project uses [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) to manage dependencies.
The Gradle wrapper was included, so you can run Gradle tasks using `gradlew.bat` or `./gradlew` commands.
Useful Gradle tasks and flags:

- `--continue`: when using this flag, errors will not stop the tasks from running.
- `--daemon`: thanks to this flag, Gradle daemon will be used to run chosen tasks.
- `--offline`: when using this flag, cached dependency archives will be used.
- `--refresh-dependencies`: this flag forces validation of all dependencies. Useful for snapshot versions.
- `build`: builds sources and archives of every project.
- `cleanEclipse`: removes Eclipse project data.
- `cleanIdea`: removes IntelliJ project data.
- `clean`: removes `build` folders, which store compiled classes and built archives.
- `eclipse`: generates Eclipse project data.
- `idea`: generates IntelliJ project data.
- `lwjgl3:jar`: builds application's runnable jar, which can be found at `lwjgl3/build/libs`.
- `lwjgl3:run`: starts the application.
- `test`: runs unit tests (if any).

Note that most tasks that are not specific to a single project can be run with `name:` prefix, where the `name` should be replaced with the ID of a specific project.
For example, `core:clean` removes `build` folder only from the `core` project.
